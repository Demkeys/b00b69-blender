# b00b69-blender
A custom Blender theme based on the #b00b69 color (Dark Pink). I'll work on this more over time and make changes as needed. Enjoy!

Instructions:
* Download the [theme file](https://github.com/Demkeys/b00b69-blender/blob/main/b00b69%20Dark.xml).
* In Blender, select Preferences > Themes, click Install, and select the theme file.
